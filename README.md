## Abstract

This repository is an implementation of our paper entitled “SilverMask: Face Template Protection with Fine-Grained Noise-Correction”.

In the paper, we observe that the accuracy of the previous fuzzy commitment (FC)-based biometric template protection (BTP) is confined to relatively easier datasets. We improve a FC-based BTP with respect to accuracy by presenting a real-valued error correcting code (ECC) called “SilverCode” and a loss called “GIC loss”. SilverCode is for the larger error-correcting capacity, and GIC loss is for gathering the intra-class compactness.

We will update the code soon.
